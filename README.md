# CALDToolkit

**CALDToolkit** is a web-based platform designed to support researchers and practitioners in improving engagement with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities throughout the research lifecycle. It offers an integrated suite of tools and resources, including best practice guidelines, blogs, interactive visualizations, and case studies, with a focus on health equity and community involvement.

## 🌍 Purpose
