## Engaging CALD Populations in Population Health: A Co-Design Approach

Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations remain significantly underrepresented in Australian health data systems. Although CALD individuals constitute a large proportion of the population in regions like South Western Sydney, they are often excluded from mainstream data collection efforts, especially those with limited English proficiency or on temporary visas.

To address this gap, the Population Health Research and Epidemiology Unit at the South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) launched a three-phase project focused on co-designing inclusive approaches to CALD representation in population health.

### üìç Phase I: Mapping and Partnership Development

In this first phase, the project engages local government bodies, migrant-serving organizations, and CALD community stakeholders to understand barriers to inclusion and build trust.

- **Mapping stakeholders** across high-CALD Local Government Areas (e.g., Liverpool, Fairfield)
- Establishing governance structures and advisory groups
- Conducting consultations and scoping reviews
- Distributing small grants to community organizations for participation

**Outcome:** A deeper understanding of underrepresentation, a mapped partnership landscape, and a foundation for co-designed research.

---

### üß™ Phase II: Survey Development and Feasibility Testing

This phase develops and pilots a CALD-specific data collection tool tailored to capture cultural, linguistic, and migration-related dimensions of health.

- Tool design through workshops with community and research stakeholders
- Pilot testing in one or two LGAs
- Feedback loop to refine methodology

**Outcome:** A tested, community-approved method to collect CALD-relevant data, bridging data gaps in population health.

---

### üìà Phase III: Building Toward a Longitudinal Study

The final phase proposes a sustainable framework for longitudinal monitoring of CALD populations.

- Grant proposal development for a longitudinal cohort study
- Implementation and exit strategy planning with community partners

**Outcome:** An evidence-based, sustainable model to inform CALD-responsive health policy and research.
